# Citi_Bike
## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyze data from Citi Bike in NYC, and put the information in a dashboard to convince investors that a similar program could be successful in Des Moines

## Results
![Number_of_Trips](https://github.com/tori-taylor/Citi_Bike2/blob/main/images/Number_of_Trips.PNG)

This image shows the total number of bike trips that took place in August 2019

![Starting_Locations](https://github.com/tori-taylor/Citi_Bike2/blob/main/images/Starting_Locations.PNG)

This map shows where rides started, the bigger and darker the bubble the more rides.

![Dur](https://github.com/tori-taylor/Citi_Bike2/blob/main/images/Dur.PNG)

This line graph shows the duration of trips, here we can see that most trips are under an hour.

![Dur_gender](https://github.com/tori-taylor/Citi_Bike2/blob/main/images/Dur_gender.PNG)

This line graph shows the duration of trips by gender, here we can see that men take more trips but both men and women have a trip duration less than an hour.

![start_hour](https://github.com/tori-taylor/Citi_Bike2/blob/main/images/start_hour.PNG)

This heat map shows the amount of rides that started by week and by hour. The darked the box the more rides there were.

![start_hour_gender](https://github.com/tori-taylor/Citi_Bike2/blob/main/images/start_hour_gender.PNG)

This heat map shows the amount of rides that started by week and by hour and by gender. The darked the box the more rides there were.

![trips_user_weekdays](https://github.com/tori-taylor/Citi_Bike2/blob/main/images/trips_user_weekdays.PNG)

This heat map shows the amount of rides that started by weekday and by user type (customer vs subscriber)

## Summary
The results show that most rides are less than an hour. From the hourly / weekday analysis most rides take place during commuter hours during the week, and during the day on the weekends. Men tend to use the bikes more than women. If possible I would do this analysis with a city that had a more similar geographical landscape as Des Moines, a lot of the rides are less than an hour in NYC which may be due to the dense population. I'd also look at duration based on where someone started.
